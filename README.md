## Purpose
My purpose is to design a visually appealing, fully functional and responsive website using HTML and CSS to demonstrate my current abilities to potential employers.

## Target Audience
My target audience are prospective employers looking to hire an aspiring junior web developer, as well as my instructors and peers at Coder Academy.

## Tech Stack
- Ubuntu Terminal
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- CSS
- Markdown
- GitHub Repository
- Netlify (Deployment Platform)
- draw.io (Sitemap)
- Figma (Wireframes)
- Coolors (Colour Scheme)
- Google Font (Font Styling)
- animate.css (Animations)
- Adobe (Image Resizing and Creating GIFs)

## Functionality / Features
#### Colour Theme
Using Coolors, a summer-earthy colour palette was chosen for my website to evoke a soothing and warm feeling from the viewers. I also had website accessibility in mind; the colours have a high contract with black so viewers are able to easily read text and navigate between pages.

#### Layout
The overall layout for the website was kept simple as to not overwhelm the viewer. Layout between mobile and desktop view was also kept almost identical, with minor changes for a more appealing view or to utilise the viewport space more.

#### Typography
Using Google Fonts, Encode Sans Condensed was chosen for the website. Keeping accessibility in mind, a san-serif font type was used.

#### Animations
Animations found on animate.css were mainly used on images or buttons to help keep the website fun and exciting. Button animations were kept consistent through the entire website and several animations were used on images for some variation (image animations in a single page were kept the same to avoid overstimulation).

#### Components
- *Header tag* used to contain the navbar, this appears at the top on every page.
- *Nav tag* used to contain various links to different pages on the website, this appears at the top on every page. There is hover styling which moves the selected box in the navbar to move up and also change colour to provide website engagement.
- *Footer tag* used to show copyright, this appears at the bottom of every page.
- *Main tag* used to contain content that is not located in the header or footer of the page.
- *H#, p tags* used for different text styling, where # is a number between 1-6.
- *Section, Article tag* used to identify different sections on a single page and can be exhibited by a green background colour. There is hover styling which removes the border-radius to provide website engagement.
- *Img, figure tag* used for images/gifs throughout the website.
- *Button tag* used for all links within the main tag throughout the website. There is hover styling which depicts the button having been clicked on to provide website enagement. 
- *a tag* used for links to direct the viewer to alternative internal pages on the website or external sites.

** Desktop view is any viewport with a min width of 600px

#### Overview
** The header, navbar and footer and the same throughout the entire website to keep consistency. This is also the case for colour theme, eg. green box to separate sections within a single page.

- *Home Page* is kept simple and introduces me. The layout on mobile and desktop view are identical, only the text and image size changes between views. Button after text to link to the contact page.  

- *About Page* displays personal information about myself, my technical skills and work experience. Separate sections are indicated by the green box. Button in the work experience section links to my (mock up) resume. Layout of desktop view shows technical skills and work experience in a row as opposed to column in the mobile view as these sections correlate to one another.

- *Projects (List) Page* displays an overview of current projects. Separate projects are indicated by the green box. Each project listed on this page contains a heading, image (gif) and text to describe the project. Minor change to the wireframes - a button was also included to link to the individual project page. Layout of desktop view shows projects in row for a more visually pleasing view.

- *Projects (Individual) Page* displays more information on a single project listed in the projects (list) page. Two buttons to link to the project code (in Github) and deployment (via Netlify) respectively. Buttons are disabled if the link is currently available (seen in Project 3 page).

- *Blogs Page* contains all blog posts. Separate blog posts are indicated by the green box. Each blog post has a heading, published date, image (gif) and text. Layout of desktop view shows blog posts in row for a more visually pleasing view.

- *Contact Page* is kept simple and contains three options to get in touch with me - email, GitHub and LinkedIn. Layout for desktop view shows image and contact option in row for a more visually pleasing view.
